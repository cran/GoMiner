Description: In gene-expression microarray studies, for example, one generally obtains a list of
 dozens or hundreds of genes that differ in expression between samples and then asks
 'What does all of this mean biologically?' Alternatively, gene lists can be derived conceptually
 in addition to experimentally. For instance, one might want to analyze a group of genes known
 as housekeeping genes. The work of the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium <geneontology.org>
 provides a way to address that question. GO organizes genes into hierarchical categories based
 on biological process, molecular function and subcellular localization. The role of 'GoMiner'
 is to automate the mapping between a list of genes and GO, and to provide a statistical
 summary of the results as well as a visualization.
